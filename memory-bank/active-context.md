# Current Context

## Ongoing Tasks

- Verify sensor-display client against sensor-bridge server compatibility
- Fix MAC address format compatibility issue
- Fix static data usage in client
## Known Issues

- MAC address format mismatch potential
- Client not using received static data (fonts, images)
- Missing static data integration in renderer
## Next Steps

- Test MAC address format compatibility
- Update client to use static data from registration
- Pass static data to renderer in client
## Current Session Notes

- [3:09:57 PM] [Unknown User] Fixed client-server compatibility issues: Successfully identified and resolved two critical compatibility issues between sensor-display client and sensor-bridge server:

1. MAC Address Format Mismatch:
   - Problem: Client sends uppercase MAC (7C:21:4A:40:28:51), server expects lowercase (7c:21:4a:40:28:51)
   - Solution: Added normalize_mac_address() function to client that matches server's normalization logic
   - Impact: Prevents registration failures

2. Missing Static Data Integration:
   - Problem: Client receives fonts/images during registration but doesn't use them in rendering
   - Solution: Modified start_http_client() to store static data and pass it to renderer
   - Impact: Enables proper rendering with server-provided assets

Both fixes ensure full protocol compatibility between client and server implementations.
- [3:08:39 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Client-Server MAC Address Compatibility Issue
- [3:00:23 PM] [Unknown User] Updated /api/register endpoint handling: Successfully updated the sensor-display application to match the new API specification:

1. ✅ Replaced old TransportMessage parsing with new StaticClientData struct
2. ✅ Updated registration method to deserialize single bincode struct instead of three separate messages
3. ✅ Fixed RegistrationResult to use HashMap types for text_data, static_image_data, and conditional_image_data
4. ✅ Updated comments and logging to reflect new API structure
5. ✅ Compilation successful with no errors

Key changes:
- StaticClientData struct now matches API specification exactly
- Single bincode::deserialize() call replaces complex multi-message parsing
- Proper HashMap data structures for font, static image, and conditional image data
- Updated Cargo.toml comment to reflect StaticClientData instead of TransportMessage

The application is now ready to work with the updated /api/register endpoint that returns binary StaticClientData instead of the old TransportMessage format.
- [2:47:15 PM] [Unknown User] Implemented binary data transfer for registration endpoint: Successfully implemented a solution to transfer text_data, static_image_data, and conditional_image_data to clients through the registration HTTP endpoint using bincode serialization. The implementation includes:

1. Created StaticClientData struct to bundle all three data types
2. Updated prepare_static_data_for_client function to serialize data with bincode
3. Modified registration endpoint to return binary data with proper content-type
4. Used existing bincode dependency for efficient serialization
5. Added proper error handling and logging

The solution is efficient, uses existing dependencies, and follows best practices for binary data transfer over HTTP.
- [8:09:13 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: HTTP Client Registration Update Completed
- [8:08:48 AM] [Unknown User] Updated HTTP client registration method: Successfully updated the register method to handle binary data instead of JSON response. Fixed compilation error with response usage. The method now processes three types of preparation data (text, static image, conditional image) from binary TransportMessage structs serialized with bincode. Added proper error handling for both JSON errors and binary data processing.
- [8:04:41 AM] [Unknown User] Analyzed current HTTP client implementation: Found that the current register method uses ureq to send JSON and expects JSON response. Need to update to handle binary data with three types of preparation data: text, static image, and conditional image. The binary data contains TransportMessage structs serialized with bincode.
