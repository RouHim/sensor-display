## Update History

- [2025-06-30 7:18:40 PM] [Unknown User] - Verified implementation against API specification: Completed verification of HTTP client implementation against the official API.md specification. All data structures, endpoints, error handling, and request/response formats match perfectly. The ureq-based client is fully compliant with the sensor-bridge server API.
- [2025-06-30 7:03:00 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed migration from reqwest to ureq: Successfully replaced reqwest (async) with ureq (synchronous) HTTP client. Updated Cargo.toml dependencies, converted http_client.rs to use ureq's synchronous API, removed tokio::main from main.rs, and verified successful compilation in both debug and release modes.
- [2025-06-30 6:57:19 PM] [Unknown User] - Starting migration from reqwest to ureq: User requested to replace reqwest (async) with ureq (sync) HTTP client. This will simplify the codebase by removing async/await complexity and tokio dependency.
- [2025-06-30 6:56:06 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed HTTP migration and testing: Successfully removed old tcp_receiver.rs file, completed release build with only minor warnings about unused fields (which is normal), and verified no CI/CD pipeline files need updating. The application now fully uses HTTP communication instead of TCP.
- [2025-06-30 6:50:39 PM] [Unknown User] - Updated README.md documentation: Completely rewrote README.md to document the new HTTP-based communication protocol, added configuration instructions, setup steps, troubleshooting guide, and removed all references to the old TCP approach
- [2025-06-30 6:47:53 PM] [Unknown User] - Created HTTP client module and updated main.rs: Implemented new http_client.rs module with MAC address detection, client registration, and sensor data polling. Updated main.rs to use async/await pattern and HTTP client instead of TCP receiver.
- [2025-06-30 6:46:21 PM] [Unknown User] - Updated Cargo.toml dependencies: Replaced message-io TCP dependency with reqwest HTTP client, added tokio async runtime, serde_json for JSON handling, and mac_address crate for MAC address detection
